## Purpose of analysis:

To understand if we have better retention rate when moving the gate from level 30 to level 40?

As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress. In addition to driving in-app purchases, these gates serve the important purpose of giving players an enforced break from playing the game, hopefully resulting in that the player's enjoyment of the game being increased and prolonged.


## Method of analysis:

1.Probability density function(pdf) plot

2.Bootstrap resampling

3.Calculating the probability that D1 vs D7 retention is greater when the gate is at level 30
