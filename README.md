## Purpose of analysis:

To understand if we should move the gate from level 30 to level 40?

Because from the data we see, the level 30 retention_rate-D1 and retention_rate-D7 are higher than level 40 retention_rate.

## Method of analysis:

1.probability density function(pdf) plot

2.bootstrap resampling

3.Calculating the probability that D1 vs D7 retention is greater when the gate is at level 30
